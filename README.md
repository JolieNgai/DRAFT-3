Here is my personal portfolio website 

DESIGN PROCESS: 
This website is meant to cater as a portoflio type website. Gradually, as I progress my studies in Ngee Ann Poly, I will keep adding on and making it look nicer as I learn more about 
HTML, CSS and Javascript. The intended purpose of this website is to list down my accomplishments and achievements in addition to showcasing how my skills in programming have progresses 
and grow. I wanted to start off with a very simple layout with not many features as to clearly showcase my intentions for the website. With some image slideshows that showcase some of my
works and some highlights of my life so far. 

Features: 
So one of the features I added was a navigation bar where users can toggle back and forth between pages. Additionally, there is an image slideshow to show some photos of me and my works.
In the future, I hope to add more features like for example, if I do a project using an external software like Adobe Illustrator, upon cliking on the link, users will be able to see my 
illustrator file and perhapd edit. I could create an interactive section where users can add in their own edits of my work or even an email me segment where all they need to do is type 
in a message and click send on my website to contact me.

TECHNOLOGIES USED: 
I just used CSS and HTML to create my page. Additionally, I used https://fontawesome.com/ for my social media icons
